## Introduction

This repository contains explanations, theories, and code implementations of various data structures. It is designed to be a helpful resource for students, educators, and anyone interested in computer science.

## Big O Notation Theory

Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's running time. It provides a high-level understanding of the time and space complexity of algorithms.



### Key Concepts

- **O(1)**: Constant time complexity
- **O(n)**: Linear time complexity
- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time complexity
- **O(n^2)**: Quadratic time complexity

Here is the Big O notation theory:

## Pointers Notation Theory

Pointers are variables that store the memory address of another variable. They are a fundamental concept in languages like C and C++ and are essential for implementing data structures efficiently.
